# Shopify eShipper Integration

<!-- Overview -->

## Overview

This integration project focuses on calculating and managing the discrepancy between the customer's paid price and the shipping charges levied by eShipper for a specific order. The primary objective is to identify and reduce the variance between what the customer pays and the actual shipping cost incurred by the courier company.

<!-- Objectives -->

## Objectives

### 1. Price Discrepancy Analysis

The integration aims to analyze the difference between the customer's paid price and the charges imposed by eShipper for each order. It involves scrutinizing various factors contributing to this discrepancy, including:

- Lack of product dimensions in the system.
- Time gap between order placement and label creation.
- Technical intricacies affecting the pricing structure.

### 2. Minimizing Price Gap

Efforts are directed towards minimizing the difference in pricing by implementing measures that align the customer-paid amount closer to the actual shipping cost. Strategies include:

- Optimizing product dimension input to ensure accurate pricing.
- Streamlining the order-to-label creation process to reduce time-based variations.
- Addressing technical aspects affecting pricing inconsistencies.

### 3. Accuracy Testing of 4D Boxing Algorithm

A critical aspect involves evaluating the precision of the 4D boxing algorithm, which functions as a proprietary black box within eShipper's framework. The project focuses on verifying and enhancing the accuracy of this algorithm to effectively calculate shipping costs.
